Integrate Broadstreet business directory and adserving power into your site.

== Description ==

For Broadstreet users. If you aren't a user, you can sign up after installing.

Introducing first business directory of it's kind, this Broadstreet-powered
plug-in is the first practical and portable business directory for Wordpress.

This was built for local publishers.

* Magic import: Automatically crawl the web to fill in business details and photos
* Business updates: Allow businesses to post a message on their profile via text message, Facebook, or Twitter
* Easily create a photo gallery for each business

... And everything else you would expect of a business directory.

Broadstreet was build by the developers of a local, independent news blog in
Red Bank, NJ. We built it to help monetize our much-loved community site.
If you're a local publisher struggling to monetize your site, Broadstreet is
for you.

PS: You can easily integrate your Broadstreet adserver zones with this
plugin too.

**How to:**

1. Install the plugin
2. Go to Settings->Broadstreet
3. Enter your Access Token and confirm that it's valid (we'll check automatically)
4. Go to Appearance->Widgets, and use the new 'Broadstreet Ad Zone' widget
